                Well, "kinda" might be understating it a bit. Since I was a little kid, I've always had a fascination with technology.
                From video games, to weekly Google podcasts, I spend most of my free time consuming, understanding, and creating technology. Typically, I work on Front-End web development projects: Building Javascript enabled Webapps ect. However I also often work with Server-Side Javascript in Node.js and SQL Databases.
                I dabble in Dev-Ops from time to time, but don't quote me on that!

                  Like many kids, I was big into video games.
                  I could spend hours infront of the TV lost in the world that I was playing in.
                  Aside from the the flashy polygonal graphics of games like Mario 64,
                  what grabbed me was the
                </p>

                <h3>Maker & IoT</h3>

                <h3>Android</h3>


                <h3>Podcasts</h3>
                <p>
                 I'm not a huge book-reader. I've just never gotten into it, I'm much more of an audio person.
                 That's where Podcasts come in.
                 Something about this medium for media consumption grabbed me. For almost a decade, since podcasts we're still in their infancy,
                 I've been a dedicated listener.
